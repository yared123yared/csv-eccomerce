  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
# assets:
#     - assets/images/login/
#     # - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  assets:
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/login/

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
